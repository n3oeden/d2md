DNA-Drug Molecular Docking Suite

The suite aims to help automatizing and batch processing the molecular docking studies of DNA-Drug complexes. All the upcoming programs work on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Note: The suite version is 1.0 but it has to be considered in early-stage development, thus no documentation is available nor comments are added to the source code; this one is likely to contain some bugs and GUI glitches.
